# react_tailwind_template v1.0.0

## About This Template

This template is designed for quickly scaffolding the base structure of a React application with Tailwind for styling. Vite is used as the bundler, and Prettier and ESLint are configured for assisting the developer. 

The following plugins were installed and configured to prevent conflicts between ESLint, TailwindCSS, and Prettier:

- eslint-plugin-tailwindcss
- prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
- eslint-config-prettier
